## 📚 Koray's Query Network Concept

### **What is a Query Network Page?**

**Koray's Definition**:
> "Don't target single keywords. Target QUERY NETWORKS - groups of related searches that form semantic clusters."

**Traditional Approach** (Wrong):
```
Page 1: "Jeddah airport taxi"
Page 2: "Jeddah airport prayer room"
Page 3: "Jeddah airport SIM card"
Page 4: "Jeddah airport Ihram"
... (50 separate pages)
```

**Query Network Approach** (Koray's Way):
```
ONE Page: "Jeddah Airport Complete Guide"
├── Answers ALL 50+ related queries
├── Comprehensive resource
├── User doesn't need to search elsewhere
└── Search engines LOVE this
```

## 🔥 Koray's Micro-Semantics Applied

### **Example 1: Terminal Information**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"Jeddah Airport has multiple terminals."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"Terminal 1 (New Terminal) serves Saudia and major international airlines. 
North Terminal serves some budget carriers. The old South Terminal is closed. 
Check your airline: Saudia/Flynas/major international = Terminal 1."
```

**Difference**:
- Specificity: Terminal names and numbers
- Airlines: Exact carriers listed
- Guidance: How to determine your terminal
- Warning: Old terminal closed

### **Example 2: Prayer Room**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"Prayer rooms are available."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"Terminal 1: Prayer room on Level 2 (after security). Separate sections 
for men and women. Wudu facilities available. Prayer times displayed on screens."
```

**Difference**:
- Location: Exact level and position
- Access: After security (timing info)
- Facilities: Men/women, wudu
- Convenience: Prayer times visible
