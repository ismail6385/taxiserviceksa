## 🚀 Koray's Micro-Semantics Examples

### **Example 1: Business Districts (Riyadh)**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"We serve business districts in Riyadh."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD): 35 km from airport (30-40 min). 
Major banks, financial institutions. Peak traffic: 7-9 AM, 4-6 PM."
```

**Difference**:
- Specificity: Exact district name (KAFD)
- Distance: Precise km and time
- Context: Banks, institutions
- Timing: Peak hours

### **Example 2: Corporate Facilities (Riyadh)**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"We offer corporate accounts."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"Corporate accounts available. Invoice sent monthly. Payment via bank transfer. 
Minimum 10 trips/month."
```

**Difference**:
- Billing: Monthly invoicing
- Payment: Bank transfer (specific)
- Minimum: 10 trips (threshold)

### **Example 3: KAFD Access (Riyadh)**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"We can take you to KAFD."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"Security checkpoint at KAFD entrance. Have meeting invitation ready. 
Driver can't enter without authorization. Drop-off at gate."
```

**Difference**:
