## 🧱 STEP 2: CONTENT ARCHITECTURE RULES

### Page Structure (STRICT)
```
H1 → service + location/entity
├── Direct factual explanation (above the fold)
├── How the service works
├── When & why users need it
├── Booking method (email/form)
├── Related internal links (same cluster only)
└── FAQs (facts, not opinions)
```

### Writing Rules
- ❌ No storytelling fluff
- ❌ No marketing hype
- ❌ No opinions
- ✅ Facts only
- ✅ Neutral, informative tone
- ✅ Trust-focused
- ✅ Short when possible, long when necessary

---

## 🧠 STEP 3: MICRO-SEMANTIC OPTIMIZATION

### Move Answers to the Top
- Key information above the fold
- No hiding critical details mid-page

### Use Service → Function → Context
Example:
```
❌ "Best airport taxi in Jeddah"
✅ "Airport taxi service from King Abdulaziz Airport to Makkah"
   - What it is: Direct transfer service
   - When it's used: Upon flight arrival
   - Who needs it: Umrah pilgrims, tourists
   - How booking works: Online form or email
```

### Rephrase Facts in Multiple Formats
- Sentence
- List
- Short explanation
- Table (where applicable)

---

## 🔗 STEP 4: INTERNAL LINKING (ONTOLOGY-BASED)

### Valid Attributes for Linking
- Same city
- Same service type
- Same user intent

### Link Structure
```
✅ "Jeddah Airport Taxi" → "Makkah Hotels" (same journey)
✅ "Umrah Taxi" → "Ziyarat Locations" (same user intent)
✅ "GMC Yukon" → "Family Transport" (same vehicle type)

❌ Random cross-linking
❌ Keyword-forced anchors
```

### Anchor Text Rules
- Descriptive anchors
- Contextual sentences
- Heading-based links where relevant

---

## 🧹 STEP 5: URL & CONTENT PRUNING

### Reduce Unnecessary URLs
- Remove thin pages
- Remove duplicated service/location combos
- Consolidate weak pages into stronger ones

### New Pages = Clear Purpose Only
- One intent per page
- One main entity per page
- One dominant search intent

**Principle**: Fewer pages → higher trust → better ranking state

---

## ⚙️ STEP 6: NEXT.JS TECHNICAL RULES

### Performance
- Use Server Components where possible
- Fast TTFB (target <150ms)
- Lean HTML
- Image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)

### Metadata
```typescript
{
  title: "Clear, factual title",
  description: "Direct explanation of service",
  canonical: "https://taxiserviceksa.com/[path]",
  openGraph: { ... }
}
```

### Status Codes
- 200 / 304 only (≥98%)
- No crawl waste
- No 404s from internal links

---

## 📈 STEP 7: RANKING STATE DISCIPLINE

### Correct Signals (in order)
1. Impressions rise first
2. Indexing stabilizes
3. Discover traffic appears
4. Branded queries grow
5. Click-through rate improves

### What to Expect
- If impressions rise but clicks lag → **NORMAL**
