- Functional details prioritized

### **✅ Entity-Oriented**
- Clear entities: Taxi Service, GMC Yukon, Airport Transfer
- Proper predicates: operates, includes, accommodates, provides
- Context: Saudi Arabia, 8 cities, 24/7, specific features

### **✅ Contact Compliance**
- ❌ Removed: All WhatsApp CTAs
- ✅ Added: Email CTAs (taxiserviceksa9988@gmail.com)
- ✅ Maintained: Booking form links

## 💡 KORAY'S METHODOLOGY - KEY LEARNINGS

### **1. Entity-First Always**
> "Tom Hanks is the entity... according to the predicates... search engine will understand"

**Applied:**
- "GMC Yukon accommodates..." (not "Our GMC Yukon can...")
- "Taxi Service KSA operates..." (not "We operate...")
- "Airport transfers in Saudi Arabia..." (not "We provide airport transfers...")

### **2. Micro-Semantics Matter**
> "By just changing the order of words... you can create a macro difference"

**Applied:**
- "Taxi Service in Saudi Arabia" (entity first)
- "GMC Yukon taxi service includes driver" (entity → predicate → object)
- "Service operates 24/7" (service entity, not "we")

### **3. Cost of Retrieval**
> "Decreasing the cost that you are creating for the search engine"

**Applied:**
- Factual statements (easier to verify)
- Clear entities (easier to parse)
- No ambiguity (no "reliable", "best")
- Specific details (7 passengers, 5 bags, not "spacious")
