```

#### 2. H1 Heading
```
[Adjective] [Service] in [Location] - [Benefit] [Target Audience]

Example:

```
As a [trusted/premier/leading] [service] in [location], we specialize in 
[specific service] for [target audience]. Our [service type] helps [audience] 
with [specific benefits].

transfers from King Abdulaziz International Airport. Our professional chauffeurs 
help travelers with luxury pickups, meet and greet services, and comfortable 
rides to hotels, Makkah, and Madinah.
```

#### 4. Service List (Bullet Points)
```
Each bullet = RDF Triple:

   the 450km journey with rest stops and prayer breaks
```

## 🔍 How Google Interprets Your RDF Triples

### Before RDF Triples:
```
"We offer taxi service in Jeddah"
```
❌ Google sees: Generic taxi service, unclear what you do

### After RDF Triples:
```
"Airport transfer service in Jeddah provides 24/7 chauffeur service from 
King Abdulaziz International Airport for travelers and Umrah pilgrims"
```
✅ Google understands:
- WHO: Airport transfer service in Jeddah
- WHAT: provides 24/7 chauffeur service
- WHERE: from King Abdulaziz International Airport
- FOR WHOM: travelers and Umrah pilgrims

**Result:** Better matching for searches like:
- "airport transfer jeddah"
- "chauffeur service king abdulaziz airport"
- "taxi jeddah airport to makkah"
- "umrah taxi service jeddah"
