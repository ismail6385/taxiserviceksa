# Lily Ray's GEO, AEO, & AI Search Strategy

Based on insights from Lily Ray's MozCon 2025 presentation. The core premise is that **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** is essentially **SEO** but with new KPIs and a focus on "Atomic Answers" and Brand Authority.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
*   **"GEO is just SEO":** Don't get distracted by hype. Strong foundational SEO (technical, content, links) drives AI visibility because LLMs use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) which fetches from search indexes.
*   **AI is Expansionary:** People use AI *in addition* to Google, not just *instead* of it.

## 2. New KPIs to Monitor
*   **Branded Impressions:** Are people searching for your brand more? (AI recommends brands).
*   **Share of Voice in AI:** Use tools (or manual checks) to see if you appear in ChatGPT/Gemini answers for your core topics.
*   **Direct & Organic Homepage Traffic:** AI answers often lead users to search for the brand directly.

## 3. "Atomic Content" Optimization
LLMs see "tokens," not pages. Content must be "chunk-able."
- [ ] **Atomic Answers:** Ensure every core question (Who, What, Where, How much) has a clear, concise, self-contained answer (2-3 sentences max) that stands alone.
- [ ] **Structure:** Use `<h1>` for main entities, `<h2>` for sub-topics, and `Lists/Tables` for data. LLMs love structured data.

## 4. Brand Authority & "Branded Questions"
You must define your own brand entity before someone else (or a hallucination) does.
- [ ] **The "Who Is" Test:** Does your site explicitly answer "Who is [Brand Name]?", "Is [Brand Name] legitimate?", "Where is [Brand Name] located?"
- [ ] **Consistency:** Ensure NAP (Name, Address, Phone) and "About Us" details are identical across all platforms (Site, GMB, LinkedIn, Trustpilot).

## 5. Reputation Management (Off-Page)
LLMs cite "Human" sources like Reddit, Wikipedia, and YouTube.
- [ ] **Reddit/Quora:** authentically participate in discussions. Don't spam; provide value.
- [ ] **YouTube:** Create video answers to your core FAQs. LLMs transcribe and cite these.

## 6. Personalization & Localization
- [ ] **Contextual Content:** Don't just generic content. Create specific content for specific personas (e.g., "Umrah Taxi for Families" vs "Solo Business Traveler").
- [ ] **Multilingual:** If relevant, translate content textually (not just auto-translate) to capture non-English AI queries.
