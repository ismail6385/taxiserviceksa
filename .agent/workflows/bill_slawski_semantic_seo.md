# Bill Slawski's Semantic & Entity SEO SOP

Based on the core principles of Google Patents (Phrase-Based Indexing, Ontologies, and Entity Associations).

## 1. SERP Space Analysis (Intent Check)
Before writing, analyze the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) for your target query.
- [ ] **Feature Check:** specific content types ranking? (e.g., Knowledge Panels, "People Also Ask", Videos, Maps).
- [ ] **Content Formats:** Are competitors using long-form guides, tools, or transactional pages?
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis:** Look at reviews/snippets in Knowledge Panels. What is the prevailing sentiment?

## 2. Ontology & Information Architecture
Organize content hierarchically to establish topical authority, similar to how an Image Search separates entities into categories.
- [ ] **Subject Breakdown:** Break the topic down into its logical components (e.g., Car -> Engine, Tires, Carburetor).
- [ ] **Project Structure:**
    - **Main Entity:** The core service/product (e.g., "Umrah Taxi").
    - **Attributes:** Price, Distance, Time, Vehicle Types.
    - **Related Entities:** Landmarks (kaaba), Airports (KAIA), Cities.

## 3. Phrase-Based Indexing (Co-occurrence)
Google indexes "meaningful complete phrases" that co-occur on valid pages about a topic.
- [ ] **Identify Body Hits:** meaningful phrases that naturally appear in the text (e.g., "Oval Office" on a page about "President").
- [ ] **Contextual Vectors:** Use words that *predict* the topic, not just synonyms. (e.g., for "Snowmobile", use "miles per hour", "snow depth" - words that add context).

## 4. The "Expert Link" Strategy (Anchor Hits)
Transforming "Body Hits" into "Anchor Hits" is a powerful signal.
- [ ] **The Strategy:**
    1. Identify a meaningful phrase on Page A (e.g., "Jeddah Airport") that is relevant to Page B.
    2. Turn that text phrase into an internal link pointing to Page B.
- [ ] **Why:** A link from a "frequently co-occurring phrase" (Body Hit) is treated as an **"Expert Link"** and carries higher weight than a generic link.

## 5. Passage Optimization
Google ranks specific passages for questions seeking answers.
- [ ] **Heading Structure:** Ensure the passage has a clear Heading (H2/H3) that provides context.
- [ ] **Page Title:** Acts as the "Root Heading".
- [ ] **Answer Format:** Provide a clear, natural language answer. Don't just stuff keywords; provide the "answer passage" Google looks for.
