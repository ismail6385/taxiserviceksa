# Keyword Research & Content Implementation Strategy

This workflow outlines how to build a dominant website structure using "Pillar Pages" and "Cluster Content," as described in Session 3.

## 1. terminology

*   **Seed Keyword**: The broad niche topic (e.g., "Umrah Taxi", "Jeddah Airport Transfer").
*   **Pillar Keyword (The Hub)**: High-volume, broad keywords. Targeted by **Pages** (not posts).
    *   *Example*: "Umrah Taxi Service", "Jeddah to Makkah Taxi".
*   **Information/Long-Tail Keywords (The Spokes)**: Specific questions, "How to", "Vs", or long queries. Targeted by **Blog Posts**.
    *   *Example*: "Price of taxi from Jeddah airport to Haram 2025", "Is Uber available in Makkah?".

## 2. The Strategy: "Pillar & Cluster" Model

Instead of writing random blog posts, we build **Topical Authority**.

1.  **Identify a Pillar**: Choose a main service (e.g., "Umrah Transport").
2.  **Create a Power Page**: Build a comprehensive LANDING PAGE (2000+ words) covering everything:
    *   Booking info
    *   Prices
    *   Vehicle types
    *   FAQ
    *   Routes
3.  **Find Supporting Keywords (The Cluster)**:
    *   Use Google Auto-suggest: Type "Umrah taxi..." and see completions.
    *   Use "People Also Ask" questions.
    *   Use pattern: `[Seed] + price`, `[Seed] + reviews`, `[Seed] + vs train`.
4.  **Create Supporting Posts**: Write 10-15 blog posts answering these specific questions.
5.  **Interlink**:
    *   **Crucial Step**: Every blog post MUST link back to the Pillar Page ("For booking, visit our [Umrah Taxi Service] page").
    *   The Pillar Page links out to these guides in a "Resources" or "Related Guides" section.

## 3. Implementation Steps for TaxiServiceKSA

### Step A: Define Pillars (Services Pages)
*   **Pillar 1**: `services/umrah-transport` (Target: "Umrah Taxi Service")
*   **Pillar 2**: `routes/jeddah-makkah` (Target: "Jeddah to Makkah Taxi")
*   **Pillar 3**: `locations/madinah` (Target: "Madinah Ziyarat Taxi")

### Step B: Generate Cluster Content (Blog Posts)
*   *Action*: Create a list of 20 long-tail keywords.
*   *Format*: `how-to`, `cost-of`, `best-way-to`.

### Step C: Execute
1.  **Update Pillar Page**: Ensure it has "Rich Content" (Videos, FAQs, heavy text) to compete with Wikipedia-style depth.
2.  **Write Cluster Posts**: Use the "Advanced Content Writing" workflow to write these.
3.  **Link**: Add the internal links.

## 4. Tools (Free)
*   **Google Search**: Look at "Related Searches" at the bottom.
*   **Site Search**: `site:reddit.com "umrah taxi"` to find real user questions.
*   **Competitor Analysis**: Look at top ranking sites -> see their "Blog" or "Articles" section -> Copy their headings.
