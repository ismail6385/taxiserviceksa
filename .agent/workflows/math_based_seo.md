# Kyle Roof's SEO Strategy
Based on "On Page SEO Secrets With Kyle Roof" Interview.

## 1. Avalanche Theory (Internal Linking)
**Concept:** Build authority in tiers. Win low-competition terms (your tier) to build authority for higher tiers.
**Structure:**
**Structure & Tier Calculation:**
1.  **Calculate Your Tier:** Take your site's average **daily clicks** over the last 3 months. This number is the **monthly search volume** you can easily rank for (e.g., 50 daily clicks = Target keywords with ~50 MSV).
2.  **Create Cluster:** Create ~5 supporting pages targeting these "Tier" keywords.
3.  **Strict Siloing Rule (The Boost):**
    *   **Link UP:** Supporting pages must link to the **Target Money Page**.
    *   **Link TIGHT:** For maximum boost, supporting pages should *only* link to the Target Page in the body (limit other internal links to 3 max).
    *   **Link ACROSS:** Supporting pages can link to each other, but prioritizing the Target Page is key.
4.  **Result:** This creates an "engine of good" where authority circulates and pushes the main page up.

**Virtual Silos (Leveraging Archives):**
*   **Concept:** Don't let old blog posts gather dust.
*   **Action:** Find old blog posts that have traffic/clicks but no strategic purpose. Edit them to link to your **Target Money Page** (and nothing else). This is "free authority" you already own.

## 2. On-Page Optimization (Math-Based)
**Concept:** Give Google the page it *wants* (based on SERP analysis) and use mathematical entity relevance.
**Steps:**
1.  **SERP Analysis:** Check the top ranking pages. Are they blogs? Product pages? Roundups? **Match the intent**.
2.  **The "50kb Rule":** Ensure the core keyword and value prop appear in the first 50kb of the page code (keep header/nav lean).
3.  **Climbing the Ladder:** Don't aim for 100% optimization immediately.
    *   Optimize to ~80%. Wait for cache.
    *   Optimize to ~85%. Wait.
    *   Optimize to ~90%.
    *   *Rationale:* This builds momentum and looks more natural.
4.  **Indexing & Caching Check:**
    *   **Pro Tip:** Use `cache:yoururl.com` in Google.
    *   **Goal:** You want to see a cache date within the last 7-10 days. If the cache is old (or a 404), Google is ignoring your page.
    *   **Fix:** Force a crawl via Search Console or add fresh internal links to "wake it up."
5.  **Ad Density & layout Shift (CLS):**
    *   **Warning:** Google penalizes sites with high ad density (>30%) or poor layout stability (CLS).
    *   **Check:** Ensure ads or popups do not cover content on mobile. Fix "layout shifts" so users can read comfortably. This is often a silent killer for rankings.

## 3. The "60% Rule" (Vital 4 Keyword Spots)
**Concept:** Placing your exact target keyword in these 4 spots solves ~60% of SEO issues immediately.
**The 4 Spots:**
1.  **Meta Title:** (HTML Title Tag)
2.  **H1 Tag:** (Main Heading)
3.  **Body Content:** (Inside `<p>` paragraph tags)
4.  **URL:** (The web address slug)
**Action:** Ensure the *exact* primary keyword appears at least once in all 4 locations. Do not overthink it.

**Title Strategy (SEO vs. Social):**
*   **SEO Title (Meta/H1):** Keep it boring and exact-match for the algorithm (e.g., "Makkah to Jeddah Taxi - Fixed Price").
*   **Social Title (OG Tags):** Make it "Clicky" and viral for humans (e.g., "Don't Take the Train! Why Private Taxis are the Best Way to Travel.")
*   *Why?* You rank with the SEO title, but you win social/discover traffic with the Clicky title.

## 4. "Related Searches" & Keyword Strategy
**Primary vs. Secondary:**
*   **Concept:** Optimizing for the Primary Keyword often helps you win Secondary keywords automatically.
*   **Tiebreaker Rule:** If unsure between two keywords (e.g., "taxi jeddah to makkah" vs "jeddah to makkah taxi"):
    1.  Search both in Google.
    2.  Check the **Meta Titles** (HTML Titles) of top results.
    3.  **Action:** Choose the phrase that appears most frequently in the titles of the top ranking pages. Google favors this phrasing.

**Related Searches Hack:**
1.  Google your keyword.
2.  Scroll to "Related Searches".
3.  Pick a "Lead H2" from these searches.
4.  Click that related search -> Scroll to bottom -> Find *its* related searches.
5.  **Action:** Use these terms as semantic entities/H2s.

## 5. Element-Based Content Outlining
**Concept:** Don't just write; count. Google rewards pages that match the *structure* of top results.
**Steps:**
1.  Analyze Top 3-5 Competitors.
2.  **Count Elements:**
    *   How many **H2s**?
    *   How many **Images**?
    *   Are there **Tables** or **Forms**?
3.  **Briefing:** Create a content brief based on these counts (e.g., "Page needs 7 H2s, 5 Images, 1 Table").
4.  **Write & Edit:** Write natural content first, then edit to hit the specific keyword counts and placements.

## 6. E-E-A-T (Real Business Signals) & Future-Proofing
**Concept:** "Real businesses don't have E-E-A-T problems." Google targets "doorway pages" (affiliates).
**Action:**
1.  **Be Transparent:** Display address, phone, regional operations. Make it clear who runs the site.
2.  **Schema:** Use robust **Organization** and **Person** schema.
3.  **Zero-Click Optimization:** Answer questions directly (e.g., in FAQs) to win Featured Snippets. Brand visibility > Clicks for these queries.
4.  **Sales Intel:** Use the exact language customers use on the phone, not just "industry terms".
5.  **The "Doorway Page" Defense:**
    *   **Myth:** "Affiliate sites are doorway pages."
    *   **Truth:** A doorway page is one where the user *cannot* convert/solve their problem on that page.
    *   **Fix:** If you are an affiliate, ensure the user can get 90% of the value (or even convert/contact) directly on your page. Do not just blindly funnel them to Amazon. Add real value.
6.  **Claim Third-Party Profiles:**
    *   **Concept:** Google trusts sites it ranks. If "Clutch", "ZoomInfo", or other directories rank for your brand/industry, claim those profiles.
    *   **Why?** It controls the narrative and provides a safe, trusted link. Treat these profiles like mini-websites (fill them with SEO keywords).

## 7. Metrics to Watch (Beyond Rank)
*   **Keyword Breadth:** Monitor the *number* of keywords a page ranks for. A healthy page continually picks up new long-tail keywords.
*   **Benchmarks:** Know your element counts (H2s, Images) so you can adjust if the "goal posts" move during an update.

## 8. Review Sites Warning
*   Pure review/roundup sites are being targeted by updates.
*   **Fix:** Diversify traffic sources and add real value (informational content + e-commerce/services).
## 9. The Testing Mindset & Truths (2025)
*   **User Intent Myth & Goal Post Shifts:** "User Intent" is just a fancy word for "What Google is Rewarding NOW." Do not guess. Look at the SERP. If Google rewards lists, build a list. If it rewards tools, build a tool.
    *   **Goal Post Shift:** If your page drops, "intent" likely changed. Re-check the SERP. The goal posts move.
*   **Anchor Text is King:** Google reads the anchor text. It *might* read surrounding context, but we know for sure it reads the anchor. Put the important keywords IN the link anchor.
*   **Code vs. Content:** You can rank lorem ipsum (or blank pages) if the code signals are strong. This proves structure > prose. Always start with a strong outline/code structure before writing "good copy."

## 10. Local SEO & Google Business Profile (GBP) - Advanced (2025)
**Concept:** Local SEO is distinct from Organic. It relies on **Proximity, Relevance, and Prominence**.
**The "Big 3" Ranking Factors:**
1.  **Google Business Profile (GBP)** - The most critical bucket.
2.  **Reviews** - Quantity, Quality, and Recency.
3.  **On-Page Signals** - Your website's relevance to the local signals.

### **1. GBP Optimization (The "Golden" Profile):**
*   **Primary Category:** This is critical. Be specific. "Yoga Studio" > "Gym". Match your primary seed keyword.
*   **Secondary Categories:** Use all 9 slots if relevant. Don't leave them blank.
*   **Business Name:** Do NOT keyword stuff (risk of suspension). Rebrand legally if you desperate for the keyword boost (e.g., "Smith Plumbing" -> "Smith Plumbing & Drain Repair").
*   **Completeness:** Fill strictly ALL fields. Products, Services, Q&A, Business Hours.
*   **"The Co-Working Space Loophole" (Proximity Hack):**
    *   **Problem:** You are a service business but want to rank in the city center.
    *   **Loophole:** You *can* rent a co-working space address (e.g., WeWork) **IF** it is staffed during business hours by you or a representative.
    *   **Benefit:** Gives you a physical address in the city "Core", drastically boosting proximity signals.
    *   **Warning:** Must be legitimate. No P.O. Boxes or Virtual Mailboxes.

### **2. Review Strategy (Velocity & Persistence):**
*   **The "Photo Trick" (Ranking Booster):**
    *   **Hack:** Ask your happiest customers to update their review with a **PHOTO**.
    *   **Why?** Google keeps reviews with photos at the top ("Sticky Reviews"). This pushes negative reviews down.
*   **Review Text:** Keywords in reviews help. "Best taxi in Jeddah" in a review is a ranking signal.
*   **Reputation Defense:**
    *   **Bad Review?** Respond immediately. Be polite.
    *   **Recency Bump:** Ask friends/family to "Update" their old 5-star reviews (change 1 word). This refreshes the date and bumps them to the top.

### **3. On-Page Local Signals (Website):**
*   **Structure:** Create dedicated pages for each Service + City combo.
*   **Embed Strategy:**
    1.  **Embed Your GBP Map:** Embed the interactive Google Map of your business in the footer.
    2.  **Embed YouTube Video:** Create a video (topic doesn't matter much) -> Upload to YouTube -> Put your **NAP (Name, Address, Phone)** in the YouTube description -> Embed on your site. This links Google's own property (YouTube) to your site with consistent NAP.
*   **Testimonial Hack:**
    *   Format testimonials as: *"Quote..."* - **Client Name, City, State**.
    *   *Example:* "Great ride!" - *Ahmed, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia*. (Adds naturally recurring local keywords).

### **4. Local Link Building (Citations & Backlinks):**
*   **Citations:** Consistency is key (NAP must match exactly). Use aggregators (Semrush Local, BrightLocal) to fix duplicates.
*   **Competitor Gap:** Use tools to see who links to competitors but not you.
*   **"Linkable Assets" (The Sustainable Way):**
    *   **Create Data/Tools:** "Jeddah Taxi Price Calculator" or "Umrah Travel Guide 2025" (Ultimate Guides).
    *   **Why?** People naturally link to tools and definitive guides.
*   **Local Podcasts:** Guest on local podcasts. They always link to your site, providing a hyper-local, high-relevance backlink.

**Tools to Use:**
*   **Semrush Listing Management:** For citations and rank tracking.
*   **BrightLocal / Local Falcon:** For "Grid Tracking" (Proximity heatmaps).
*   **PlePer:** For advanced local categories.
