## 🛑 STRICT WRITING RULES (KORAY'S FRAMEWORK)

1.  **NO FLUFF / NO MARKETING SPEAK:** Do not use words like "Unlock," "Unleash," "Ultimate," "Game-changer," "Delve," "Realm," or "Tapestry." Be factual, direct, and authoritative (e.g., "The distance is 85km and takes 75 minutes," NOT "Embark on a magical journey").
2.  **ENTITY DENSITY:** Every paragraph must name specific entities (Road names like *Route 15*, Gate numbers like *King Fahd Gate 79*, Specific Hotels like *Swissotel Makkah*, Neighborhoods like *Aziziyah*).
3.  **MICRO-SEMANTICS:** Focus on the "Experience Layer." Don't just say "It's hot." Say "The 45°C heat in July requires Taxis with rear-cabin AC controls, such as our GMC Yukon fleet."
4.  **CONTEXTUAL BRIDGING:** Connect the *User Intent* (Pilgrimage/Travel) to the *Service* (Taxi).
    *   *Bad:* "We offer great taxis."
    *   *Good:* "To reach the *Miqat at Dhul Hulaifah* before *Asr prayer*, pilgrims must depart Madinah by 2:30 PM using a dedicated private transfer to avoid the bus queues."
5.  **COST OF RETRIEVAL:** Use concise sentences. Use bullet points for data. Use Tables for comparisons. Make the information easy for Google to extract.
