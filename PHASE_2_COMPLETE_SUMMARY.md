## 🔥 Koray's Micro-Semantics Examples

### **Example 1: Haram Access (Makkah)**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"We drop you off near the Haram."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"King Abdul Aziz Gate (Gate 1), Umrah Gate (Gate 79), King Fahd Gate (Gate 1). 
Distance to Kaaba: 200-400 meters walking."
```

**Difference**:
- Specificity: Exact gate names and numbers
- Distance: Precise meters (not "near")
- Multiple options: 3 gates listed

### **Example 2: Tawaf Timing (Makkah)**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"You can do Tawaf anytime."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"After Fajr (5-7 AM): Less crowded. After Isha (9-11 PM): Cooler weather. 
Avoid: 12-3 PM (extreme heat)."
```

**Difference**:
- Time windows: Specific hours
- Reasons: Crowd levels, weather
- Negative advice: What to avoid

### **Example 3: Jabal al-Nour (Makkah)**

❌ **Generic**:
```
"We can take you to Jabal al-Nour."
```

✅ **Micro-Semantic**:
```
"Visit early (6-7 AM). Climb takes 30-45 min. Bring water, wear good shoes. 
Taxi waits at base (no extra charge for waiting)."
```

**Difference**:
- Timing: Specific hours
- Duration: Climb time
- Practical advice: Water, shoes
- Value-add: Free waiting
