## 🎓 Key Learnings from Jacques

### **1. Semantic SEO ≠ Keyword Lists**
- It's about **meaning and relationships**
- Connect entities through context

- "Umrah taxi" ≠ "I need transport for Umrah"
- Target both natural language and search queries

### **4. Entity Relationships Build Authority**
- Makkah + Madinah + Jeddah = Umrah context
- Routes + Locations + Vehicles = Complete solution
- Hub pages connect all related entities
