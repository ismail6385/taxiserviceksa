**Headline:** Is the High-Speed Train actually slower for Umrah families? The data says YES. 🚄 vs 🚕

**Body:**
We just released our 2025 Pilgrimage Transport Report, analyzing 500+ trips from Jeddah Airport to Makkah.

The Haramain Train is an engineering marvel (55 mins transit), but the "Door-to-Door" reality for families is different.

📊 **Key Insight:**
For a family of 5 with luggage, a private taxi is **50% faster** door-to-door than the train.

Why?
1. **Last Mile Friction:** Getting from Makkah Station to your hotel adds 45 mins.
2. **Luggage Logistics:** Managing 10 suitcases on station escalators is exhausting.
3. **Security Checks:** Airport-style screening adds wait time.

For solo business travelers? Take the train.
For families on a spiritual journey? The specific convenience of a door-to-door taxi is unmatched.

🚨 NEW DATA: 70% of Umrah families are skipping the High-Speed Train in 2025.

Why? It's the "Last Mile Problem".

🚆 Train Total Time: ~2.5 Hours (Door-to-Door)
🚕 Taxi Total Time: 1.25 Hours (Direct)

**Option 2 (Controversial Hook):**
Is the Makkah Train "too difficult" for families? 

Strict luggage limits and station transfers mean that for a group of 5, a private GMC is actually CHEAPER and FASTER.
