**New Data: 70% of Pilgrim Families Opt for Private Transfer Over High-Speed Rail for Umrah 2025**

**JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia – December 28, 2025** – Despite the technological success of the Haramain High-Speed Railway, a new operational data study released by TaxiServiceKSA reveals a counter-intuitive trend: nearly 70% of families performing Umrah are opting for private taxi transfers over the train. The study identifies "Last Mile Friction" and luggage logistics as the primary drivers of this behavior.

The 2025 Pilgrimage Transport Report analyzes the door-to-door efficiency of travel between King Abdulaziz International Airport (JED) and Makkah hotels. While the train offers a rapid 55-minute transit time, the study highlights that total travel time—including security checks, station waits, and the secondary transfer from Makkah Station to the Haram area—often exceeds 2.5 hours.

**Key Findings:**
*   **Door-to-Door Speed:** Private taxi transfers average **1 hour 15 minutes** directly from the airport curb to hotel lobbies, making them approximately **50% faster** than the total train journey for new arrivals.
*   **The "Zamzam Factor":** Strict luggage limits on the railway create significant logistical hurdles for pilgrims traveling with multiple suitcases and Zamzam water, driving families toward private vehicles that offer "touchless transfer" services.
*   **Economic Reality:** While the train is cost-effective for solo travelers, the cost break-even point is reached at 3 passengers. For a family of 5, private transfer costs are comparable to 5 economy train tickets plus required station taxis, but with significantly higher convenience.

"The Haramain Railway is an engineering marvel and perfect for business travelers," said the Operations Director at TaxiServiceKSA. "However, for a family of five arriving with luggage for their spiritual journey, the logistics of train stations simply cannot match the seamlessness of a curb-side pickup. Our data shows that 'convenience' is the ultimate currency for pilgrims."
