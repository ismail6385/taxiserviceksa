## 💡 Pro Tips for Veo/Sora:
*   **Keywords matter:** Always use words like "Cinematic", "4k", "Golden Hour", "Smooth Motion".
*   **Aspect Ratio:** Generate these in **16:9 (Landscape)** for the website headers, but also **9:16 (Vertical)** for TikTok/Shorts.
*   **No Text:** Do not ask AI to write text (like signboards) inside the video, it often messes up. Add text later in editing.
