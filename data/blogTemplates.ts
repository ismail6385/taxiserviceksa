**The Meeqat (Site of Intention)** is the geographic boundary that a pilgrim intending to perform Hajj or Umrah **must not cross** without assuming **Ihram** (state of ritual purity).

There are **5 specific Meeqat locations** established by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Bypassing these boundaries without Ihram requires a **Damm (sacrifice of a sheep)** as expiation.

### Table: The 5 Meeqat Locations

| Meeqat Name | Distance from Makkah | For Pilgrims Coming From |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dhul Hulaifah (Abyar Ali)** | 450 km (North) | Madinah |
| **Al-Juhfah (Rabigh)** | 183 km (North-West) | Egypt, Syria, North Africa, Europe |
| **Qarn al-Manazil (As-Sayl Al-Kabir)** | 75 km (East) | Riyadh, Taif, UAE, Pakistan, India |
| **Yalamlam (Sa'adiyah)** | 92 km (South) | Yemen, South Africa, Nigeria |
| **Dhat Irq** | 94 km (North-East) | Iraq, Iran, Eastern Saudi Arabia |

## 1. Dhul Hulaifah (Abyar Ali) – The Furthest Meeqat
Located **450 kilometers north of Makkah**, this is the Meeqat for pilgrims traveling from **Madinah**. It is often called **Abyar Ali** today.
*   **Significance:** It is where the Prophet (PBUH) entered Ihram for his pilgrimage.
*   **Facilities:** Includes a large mosque (Masjid Al-Shajarah) with extensive bathing and changing facilities.

## 2. Al-Juhfah (Rabigh)
Historically a village, now located near **Rabigh** (approx. 183km from Makkah).
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Egypt, Levant, and North America/Europe traveling via the coastal route.

## 3. Qarn al-Manazil (As-Sayl Al-Kabir)
Located **75km east of Makkah**, near Taif.
*   **For:** Visitors from Riyadh, Dammam, Dubai, Pakistan, and India.
*   **Note:** There is a second location called *Wadi Mahram* for those descending from Taif via the mountain road.

## 4. Yalamlam (Sa'adiyah)
Located **92km south of Makkah**.
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Yemen and those crossing the Red Sea by ship from the south.

## 5. Dhat Irq
Located **94km north-east**.
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Iraq and Iran.
*   **Status:** It is less accessible by modern highways compared to others.

### Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I am flying to Jeddah?
**Jeddah is NOT a Meeqat.** It is inside the boundary. If you fly to Jeddah for Umrah:
1.  **Wear Ihram on the plane** before crossing the Meeqat zone (usually 20-30 mins before landing).
2.  Or, travel to a Meeqat (like Dhul Hulaifah if going to Madinah first) by taxi.

### Can I wear Ihram at my hotel in Makkah?
**No**, unless you are already a resident of Makkah (Hil). For Umrah, you must go out to the nearest boundary (like Masjid Aisha/Taneem) if you are already in the city.

### Pros and Cons of Taxi to Meeqat
**Pros:**
*   Comfortable changing stops.
*   Direct travel to Makkah Haram.
*   No luggage hassle.

**Cons:**
*   More expensive than bus.

The official currency of Saudi Arabia is the **Saudi Riyal (SAR)**. It is pegged to the US Dollar at a fixed rate, providing stability for travelers.

### Exchange Rate Shortcuts (Approximate)

## Cash vs. Card
**Saudi Arabia is highly digital.**
*   **Card Acceptance:** 95% of shops, taxis, and restaurants accept Visa/Mastercard (Mada).
*   **Cash Needs:** You only need cash for small purchases like:
    *   Barbers

        content: `
**Tawaf** is the act of circumambulating (walking around) the Holy Kaaba 7 times in a counter-clockwise direction. It is a pillar of Umrah and Hajj.

### The 7 Rounds of Tawaf
Each round starts and ends at the **Hajar al-Aswad (Black Stone)** corner.

| Round # | Action | Sunnah for Men |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-3** | Walk briskly with chest out | **Ramal** (Brisk walking) |
| **4-7** | Walk at normal pace | Normal walking |

**Important Note:** **Idtiba** (uncovering the right shoulder) is only for men and ONLY during the Tawaf of Umrah/Arrival. Cover your shoulder immediately after finishing the 7th round.

## Steps to Perform Tawaf
1.  **Niyyah (Intention):** Make intention for Tawaf at the Black Stone corner.
2.  **Istilam:** Raise your right hand towards the Black Stone and say *"Bismillahi Allahu Akbar"*.
3.  **Start Walking:** Keep the Kaaba on your **left**.
4.  **Rukn al-Yamani:** When reaching the Yemeni Corner (the corner before the Black Stone), it is Sunnah to touch it if possible (do not kiss it). If crowded, just walk past.
5.  **Between Yemeni Corner & Black Stone:** Recite: *"Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasanatan wa qina adhaban-nar."*
6.  **Complete 7 Rounds.**

## Key Rules
*   **Wudu (Ablution):** You MUST be in a state of Wudu. If Wudu breaks, you must redo ablution and restart the round (scholars differ whether to restart round or whole Tawaf; restarting round is safer).
*   **Hijr Ismail (The Hatim):** Do NOT walk inside the semi-circular wall. Walking inside it invalidates that round because Hijr Ismail is part of the Kaaba.

### Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I touch the Kaaba?
During Tawaf, it is better to focus on the orbit and avoid the crush of the crowd near the walls. Touching the Kaaba is not a requirement for Tawaf validity.

### What if I lose count of rounds?
Build on certainty (the lower number). If you are unsure if it’s 3 or 4, assume it is 3 and complete the rest.

### Pros and Cons of Mataf (Ground Floor) vs. Roof
**Mataf (Ground):**
*   **Pros:** Closer to Kaaba, spiritual feeling.
*   **Cons:** Extremely crowded, slower movement.

**Roof/Upper Floors:**
*   **Pros:** Less crowded, airy, good for wheelchairs.
*   **Cons:** Much longer distance (circumference is larger).

**Mount Uhud** is not just a mountain; it is a landmark of love and sacrifice. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: *"Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it."* (Bukhari)

It was the site of the **Battle of Uhud** (3 AH), a pivotal moment in Islamic history.

### What to See at Uhud
1.  **Archers' Hill (Jabal Rumaat):** The small hillock where the Prophet (PBUH) stationed 50 archers with strict orders not to move. Their descent to collect spoils led to the turn of the battle. You can climb this hill for a panoramic view.
2.  **Shuhada Cemetery:** The resting place of **70 martyrs**, including **Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib (RA)**, the uncle of the Prophet (PBUH). It is enclosed by a fence; you can view it from the outside and recite Salam.
3.  **Uhud Mosque:** A newer masjid built near the site.

## The Battle Summary
*   **Muslim Army:** ~700 men.
*   **Quraysh Army:** ~3,000 men.
*   **Turning Point:** Khalid bin Walid (then a non-Muslim) led a cavalry charge from behind Archers' Hill after the archers abandoned their post.
*   **Lesson:** The importance of obedience to the Prophet's (PBUH) command.

### Visitor Etiquette
*   **Respect:** Maintain silence and dignity near the cemetery.
*   **No Bid'ah:** Do not throw letters, money, or grain inside the fence. Do not wipe your face on the walls.
*   **Sunnah:** Recite the Dua for visiting graves: *"Assalamu alaykum ahla al-diyar..."*

### Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I climb the big mountain?
**It is dangerous and restricted.** Visitors usually only climb the small **Archers' Hill**. The main Mount Uhud is rugged and steep.

### Is there a cave?
Yes, the **Cave of Uhud** (Ghar Uhud) where the Prophet (PBUH) took rest after being injured is higher up. However, climbing there is difficult and generally discouraged by authorities for safety reasons.

        content: `
The **Seven Mosques (Al-Masajid Al-Sab'ah)** mark the site of the **Battle of the Trench (Ghazwa Khandaq)**. This is where the Muslims dug a deep trench to defend Madinah against the Confederate armies.

Historically, these were small prayer spots used by different companions. Today, a large, modern mosque (**Masjid Al-Fath**) dominates the site, but the smaller historical structures remain.

### The Mosques
Actually, there are currently **six** structures, but traditionally they are known as seven.
1.  **Masjid Al-Fath (The Victory):** On the hilltop. It is where the Prophet (PBUH) made dua for victory for three days, and it was granted.
2.  **Masjid Salman Al-Farsi:** Named after the companion who proposed the idea of digging the trench.
3.  **Masjid Abu Bakr As-Siddiq**
4.  **Masjid Umar bin Khattab**
5.  **Masjid Ali bin Abi Talib**
6.  **Masjid Fatimah Az-Zahra** (Also known as Masjid Saad bin Muadh).

## The Battle of the Trench (5 AH)
*   **Strategy:** A defensive trench (~5.5km long) prevented enemy cavalry from entering the city.
*   **Result:** A cold wind sent by Allah destroyed the enemy camp after a month-long siege.

### Visiting Tips
*   **Location:** Located on the western side of Mount Sala.
*   **Timing:** Best visited in the morning (7 AM - 11 AM) as part of a general Ziyarat tour.
*   **Modernization:** The site has been beautifully renovated. The large new white mosque is fully air-conditioned and holds daily prayers.

### Pros and Cons of Visiting
**Pros:**
*   Deep connection to Seerah.
*   Beautiful architecture of the new masjid.
*   Great views of Madinah from the hill.

**Cons:**
*   Can be crowded with tour buses.
*   Parking can be tight during peak season.
