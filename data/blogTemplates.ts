**The Meeqat (Site of Intention)** is the geographic boundary that a pilgrim intending to perform Hajj or Umrah **must not cross** without assuming **Ihram** (state of ritual purity).

There are **5 specific Meeqat locations** established by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Bypassing these boundaries without Ihram requires a **Damm (sacrifice of a sheep)** as expiation.

### Table: The 5 Meeqat Locations

| Meeqat Name | Distance from Makkah | For Pilgrims Coming From |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dhul Hulaifah (Abyar Ali)** | 450 km (North) | Madinah |
| **Al-Juhfah (Rabigh)** | 183 km (North-West) | Egypt, Syria, North Africa, Europe |
| **Qarn al-Manazil (As-Sayl Al-Kabir)** | 75 km (East) | Riyadh, Taif, UAE, Pakistan, India |
| **Yalamlam (Sa'adiyah)** | 92 km (South) | Yemen, South Africa, Nigeria |
| **Dhat Irq** | 94 km (North-East) | Iraq, Iran, Eastern Saudi Arabia |

## 1. Dhul Hulaifah (Abyar Ali) – The Furthest Meeqat
Located **450 kilometers north of Makkah**, this is the Meeqat for pilgrims traveling from **Madinah**. It is often called **Abyar Ali** today.
*   **Significance:** It is where the Prophet (PBUH) entered Ihram for his pilgrimage.
*   **Facilities:** Includes a large mosque (Masjid Al-Shajarah) with extensive bathing and changing facilities.

## 2. Al-Juhfah (Rabigh)
Historically a village, now located near **Rabigh** (approx. 183km from Makkah).
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Egypt, Levant, and North America/Europe traveling via the coastal route.

## 3. Qarn al-Manazil (As-Sayl Al-Kabir)
Located **75km east of Makkah**, near Taif.
*   **For:** Visitors from Riyadh, Dammam, Dubai, Pakistan, and India.
*   **Note:** There is a second location called *Wadi Mahram* for those descending from Taif via the mountain road.

## 4. Yalamlam (Sa'adiyah)
Located **92km south of Makkah**.
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Yemen and those crossing the Red Sea by ship from the south.

## 5. Dhat Irq
Located **94km north-east**.
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Iraq and Iran.
*   **Status:** It is less accessible by modern highways compared to others.

### Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I am flying to Jeddah?
**Jeddah is NOT a Meeqat.** It is inside the boundary. If you fly to Jeddah for Umrah:
1.  **Wear Ihram on the plane** before crossing the Meeqat zone (usually 20-30 mins before landing).
2.  Or, travel to a Meeqat (like Dhul Hulaifah if going to Madinah first) by [private taxi](/services/umrah-transport).

### Can I wear Ihram at my hotel in Makkah?
**No**, unless you are already a resident of Makkah (Hil). For Umrah, you must go out to the nearest boundary (like Masjid Aisha/Taneem) if you are already in the city.

### Pros and Cons of Taxi to Meeqat
**Pros:**
*   Comfortable changing stops.
*   Direct travel to Makkah Haram.
*   No luggage hassle.

**Cons:**
*   More expensive than bus.

The official currency of Saudi Arabia is the **Saudi Riyal (SAR)**. It is pegged to the US Dollar at a fixed rate, providing stability for travelers.

### Exchange Rate Shortcuts (Approximate)
| Currency | Rate to SAR (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1 USD** | 3.75 SAR (Fixed) |
| **1 EUR** | ~4.00 - 4.10 SAR |
| **1 GBP** | ~4.70 - 4.80 SAR |
| **1 INR** | ~0.045 SAR (1 SAR ≈ 22 INR) |
| **1 PKR** | ~0.013 SAR (1 SAR ≈ 75 PKR) |

## Cash vs. Card
**Saudi Arabia is highly digital.**
*   **Card Acceptance:** 95% of shops, taxis, and restaurants accept Visa/Mastercard (Mada).
*   **Cash Needs:** You only need cash for small purchases like:
    *   Barbers
    *   Street food vendors
    *   Small charity/tips
    *   Some laundry shops

## Where to Exchange Money?
1.  **Banks (Best Rate):** Al Rajhi Bank, SNB, Alinma. Found throughout Makkah and Madinah.
2.  **Money Changers (Enjaz, Tahweel):** Good rates, faster service than main bank branches.
3.  **Airports:** Rates are slightly lower (more expensive) than city centers.
4.  **Hotels:** Generally offer the **worst** exchange rates. Avoid if possible.

## ATM Usage
*   **Withdrawals:** You can withdraw SAR directly from ATMs using your foreign debit card.
*   **Fees:** Check your home bank's foreign transaction fee. Saudi ATMs usually charge a small access fee for foreign cards.

### Key Takeaways

        seo_keywords: ["Tawaf rules", "How to perform Tawaf", "Umrah guide", "Tawaf duas", "Ramal and Idtiba"],
        content: `
**Tawaf** is the act of circumambulating (walking around) the Holy Kaaba 7 times in a counter-clockwise direction. It is a pillar of Umrah and Hajj. Ensure your [Umrah transport](/services/umrah-transport) drops you close to the Haram to preserve energy.

### The 7 Rounds of Tawaf
Each round starts and ends at the **Hajar al-Aswad (Black Stone)** corner.

| Round # | Action | Sunnah for Men |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-3** | Walk briskly with chest out | **Ramal** (Brisk walking) |
| **4-7** | Walk at normal pace | Normal walking |

**Important Note:** **Idtiba** (uncovering the right shoulder) is only for men and ONLY during the Tawaf of Umrah/Arrival. Cover your shoulder immediately after finishing the 7th round.

## Steps to Perform Tawaf
1.  **Niyyah (Intention):** Make intention for Tawaf at the Black Stone corner.
2.  **Istilam:** Raise your right hand towards the Black Stone and say *"Bismillahi Allahu Akbar"*.
3.  **Start Walking:** Keep the Kaaba on your **left**.
4.  **Rukn al-Yamani:** When reaching the Yemeni Corner (the corner before the Black Stone), it is Sunnah to touch it if possible (do not kiss it). If crowded, just walk past.
5.  **Between Yemeni Corner & Black Stone:** Recite: *"Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasanatan wa qina adhaban-nar."*
6.  **Complete 7 Rounds.**

## Key Rules
*   **Wudu (Ablution):** You MUST be in a state of Wudu. If Wudu breaks, you must redo ablution and restart the round (scholars differ whether to restart round or whole Tawaf; restarting round is safer).
*   **Hijr Ismail (The Hatim):** Do NOT walk inside the semi-circular wall. Walking inside it invalidates that round because Hijr Ismail is part of the Kaaba.

### Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I touch the Kaaba?
During Tawaf, it is better to focus on the orbit and avoid the crush of the crowd near the walls. Touching the Kaaba is not a requirement for Tawaf validity.

### What if I lose count of rounds?
Build on certainty (the lower number). If you are unsure if it’s 3 or 4, assume it is 3 and complete the rest.

### Pros and Cons of Mataf (Ground Floor) vs. Roof
**Mataf (Ground):**
*   **Pros:** Closer to Kaaba, spiritual feeling.
*   **Cons:** Extremely crowded, slower movement.

**Roof/Upper Floors:**
*   **Pros:** Less crowded, airy, good for wheelchairs.
*   **Cons:** Much longer distance (circumference is larger).

*   **Shoe Bags:** Always carry a shoe bag. Do not leave shoes outside; they will be removed by cleaners.
*   **Transport:** Traffic peaks around prayer times. Book your [Madinah transfer](/locations/madinah) accordingly.

**Mount Uhud** is not just a mountain; it is a landmark of love and sacrifice. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: *"Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it."* (Bukhari)

It was the site of the **Battle of Uhud** (3 AH), a pivotal moment in Islamic history.

### What to See at Uhud
1.  **Archers' Hill (Jabal Rumaat):** The small hillock where the Prophet (PBUH) stationed 50 archers with strict orders not to move. Their descent to collect spoils led to the turn of the battle. You can climb this hill for a panoramic view.
2.  **Shuhada Cemetery:** The resting place of **70 martyrs**, including **Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib (RA)**, the uncle of the Prophet (PBUH). It is enclosed by a fence; you can view it from the outside and recite Salam.
3.  **Uhud Mosque:** A newer masjid built near the site.

## The Battle Summary
*   **Muslim Army:** ~700 men.
*   **Quraysh Army:** ~3,000 men.
*   **Turning Point:** Khalid bin Walid (then a non-Muslim) led a cavalry charge from behind Archers' Hill after the archers abandoned their post.
*   **Lesson:** The importance of obedience to the Prophet's (PBUH) command.
*   **Visit:** Include Uhud in your [Madinah Ziyarat tour](/locations/madinah) for a complete historical experience.

### Visitor Etiquette
*   **Respect:** Maintain silence and dignity near the cemetery.
*   **No Bid'ah:** Do not throw letters, money, or grain inside the fence. Do not wipe your face on the walls.
*   **Sunnah:** Recite the Dua for visiting graves: *"Assalamu alaykum ahla al-diyar..."*

### Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I climb the big mountain?
**It is dangerous and restricted.** Visitors usually only climb the small **Archers' Hill**. The main Mount Uhud is rugged and steep.

### Is there a cave?
Yes, the **Cave of Uhud** (Ghar Uhud) where the Prophet (PBUH) took rest after being injured is higher up. However, climbing there is difficult and generally discouraged by authorities for safety reasons.

The **Seven Mosques (Al-Masajid Al-Sab'ah)** mark the site of the **Battle of the Trench (Ghazwa Khandaq)**. It is a key stop on our [historic Ziyarat tours](/locations/madinah). This is where the Muslims dug a deep trench to defend Madinah against the Confederate armies.

Historically, these were small prayer spots used by different companions. Today, a large, modern mosque (**Masjid Al-Fath**) dominates the site, but the smaller historical structures remain.

### The Mosques
Actually, there are currently **six** structures, but traditionally they are known as seven.
1.  **Masjid Al-Fath (The Victory):** On the hilltop. It is where the Prophet (PBUH) made dua for victory for three days, and it was granted.
2.  **Masjid Salman Al-Farsi:** Named after the companion who proposed the idea of digging the trench.
3.  **Masjid Abu Bakr As-Siddiq**
4.  **Masjid Umar bin Khattab**
5.  **Masjid Ali bin Abi Talib**
6.  **Masjid Fatimah Az-Zahra** (Also known as Masjid Saad bin Muadh).

## The Battle of the Trench (5 AH)
*   **Strategy:** A defensive trench (~5.5km long) prevented enemy cavalry from entering the city.
*   **Result:** A cold wind sent by Allah destroyed the enemy camp after a month-long siege.

### Visiting Tips
*   **Location:** Located on the western side of Mount Sala.
*   **Timing:** Best visited in the morning (7 AM - 11 AM) as part of a general Ziyarat tour.
*   **Modernization:** The site has been beautifully renovated. The large new white mosque is fully air-conditioned and holds daily prayers.

### Pros and Cons of Visiting
**Pros:**
*   Deep connection to Seerah.
*   Beautiful architecture of the new masjid.
*   Great views of Madinah from the hill.

**Cons:**
*   Can be crowded with tour buses.
*   Parking can be tight during peak season.

*   **Cons:** Heat is dangerous.
*   **Advice:**
    *   Perform Ziyarat early morning (6 AM - 8 AM).
    *   Stay in the mosque between Dhuhr and Asr.

**Ihram** is not just clothing; it is a sacred state of mind and body entered into for Umrah or Hajj.

### For Men: The Two White Sheets
Men must remove all stitched/sewn clothing (underwear, shirts, socks, etc.).
1.  **The Izar (Bottom Sheet):** Wrap it around your waist. Use a belt or money belt to secure it. Ensure your Awrah (navel to knee) is covered.
2.  **The Rida (Top Sheet):** Drape it over both shoulders.
    *   **Idtiba:** Only during Tawaf, expose the right shoulder. At all other times (prayer, Sa'i), cover both shoulders.
3.  **Footwear:** Must not cover the ankle bone (slides/flip-flops are best).

### For Women: Modest Dress
Women have no specific "Ihram cloth".
*   **Attire:** Any modest, loose-fitting clothing (Abaya). It can be any color (white or black is common but not mandatory).
*   **Face:** The face should remain uncovered (Niqab should not touch the face directly, though scholars provide solutions for this).
*   **Hands:** Gloves are not allowed.

### Common Prohibitions (Mahzuraat)
Once in Ihram (after Niyyah), you MUST NOT:
1.  Cut hair or nails.
2.  Use perfume or scented soap (unscented deodorant is allowed if applied before Niyyah).
3.  Hunt or kill animals (even insects, unless harmful).
4.  Engage in marital relations.
5.  Men cannot cover their heads (no caps/hats).

### When to Remove Ihram?
Only after completing **all** Umrah steps:
1.  Ihram
2.  Tawaf
3.  Sa'i
4.  **Halq/Taqsir (Haircut):** Once you cut your hair, you are out of Ihram and restrictions end.

        content: `
Bringing **Zamzam water** home is the highlight for every pilgrim. However, strict rules apply at airports.

### The 5-Litre Rule
*   **Size:** Only the official **5 Litre** boxed bottle is allowed. 10L bottles are no longer permitted on flights.
*   **Packaging:** It must be the official vacuum-sealed cardboard box distributed by the **King Abdullah Zamzam Water Project**.

### Who Can Take Zamzam?
*   **Umrah/Hajj Visa:** Guaranteed allowance (1 bottle per passport).
*   **Tourist Visa:** Rules fluctuate. Officially, Zamzam is for pilgrims. However, many tourists successfully check it in. **Check with your airline** specifically. Some airlines (like Saudi, Flynas) are more lenient than foreign carriers.

### Where to Buy?
**DO NOT buy from street vendors in Makkah.** They often sell fake or refilled water.

1.  **Jeddah / Madinah Airport (Best Option):**
    *   There are authorized kiosks **outside the terminal** or near check-in.
    *   **Price:** Approx 8.5 - 15 SAR (varies slightly).
    *   You show your passport/visa, pay, and they give you the box.
2.  **Authorized Supermarkets (Bin Dawood):** Sometimes stock the official boxes, but hauling them to the airport is a hassle.

### Checking In
Zamzam is usually treated as a **separate free baggage** on Saudi airlines. It goes on a dedicated conveyor belt for liquids.
*   **Tip:** Write your name clearly on the box with a marker. All boxes look identical!

**Masjid Al-Qiblatayn** (Mosque of the Two Qiblas) marks a pivotal moment in Islamic history: the change of the direction of prayer.

### The History (2 AH)
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his companions were praying Dhuhr (or Asr) prayer facing **Bait al-Maqdis (Jerusalem)**.
*   **The Revelation:** In the middle of the prayer, the verse was revealed: *"Turn then Your face in the direction of the sacred Mosque (Kaaba)"* (Quran 2:144).
*   **The Action:** The Prophet (PBUH) turned 180 degrees towards Makkah without breaking prayer, and the congregation followed him.
*   **Result:** For one prayer, they faced two Qiblas.

### Architecture
*   Historically, the mosque had two Mihrabs (prayer niches) to mark both directions.
*   **Modern Day:** During recent renovations, the niche facing Jerusalem was removed to avoid confusion for worshipers. Only the Mihrab facing Makkah remains, though the history is palpable.

### Visiting Tips
*   **Location:** North-west of Madinah, near the University of Madinah.
*   **Activity:** Pray 2 Rakaat Tahiyatul Masjid. Reflect on the obedience of the Sahaba who turned immediately upon command.

### The Basics
*   **Total Rounds:** 7 One-way trips.
*   **Start:** Safa.
*   **End:** Marwa.

### Step-by-Step Guide

2.  **Make Dua:** Raise hands and pray for yourself.
3.  **Walk towards Marwa.**

    *   **Women:** Walk normally.
5.  **Reaching Marwa:** This completes round 1. Face Kaaba, make Dua.
6.  **Return to Safa:** This is round 2.
7.  **Repeat** until 7 rounds are done.

### Rules
*   **Wudu:** Highly recommended but **not mandatory** for Sa'i (unlike Tawaf). Women in menstruation CAN perform Sa'i (but not Tawaf).
*   **Continuity:** Try not to take long breaks, though resting for a few minutes is allowed.

        content: `
**Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz International Airport (MED)** is small, modern, and very convenient. It is only **15-20 km** from the Prophet's Mosque.

### Transport Options

### 1. Official Taxis
*   **Location:** Curbside right outside arrivals.
*   **Cost:** Generally fixed/metered around **50 - 70 SAR**.
*   **Time:** 20 Minutes.
*   **Capacity:** Standard sedans (max 2-3 suitcases).

### 2. Uber / Careem
*   **Availability:** Excellent.
*   **Cost:** Often cheaper than airport taxis (**35 - 50 SAR**).
*   **Pickup:** Follow signs to the designated ride-share parking area.

### 3. SAPTCO Bus
*   **Route:** Airport to Masjid Nabawi (near various hotels).
*   **Cost:** Very cheap (~10-15 SAR).
*   **Frequency:** Every 30 minutes during peak season.
*   **Drawback:** Drop-off might be far from your specific hotel if you are on the outskirts of the Markazia.

### 4. Haramain Train
*   **Note:** The train station is **NOT** at the airport. It is in the city. You need a taxi to get from the Airport to the Train Station if you are heading straight to Makkah.

### Recommendation
For a group of 3-4, a **Taxi/Uber** is the best value and most convenient. The cost per person becomes negligible ($3-$4).

| **path** | Steep Steps | Longer, winding path |
| **Time** | ~1 Hour | **~1.5 - 2 Hours** |
| **Difficulty** | Moderate/Hard | **Hard** |

### The History
*   **The Miracle:** The spider spun a web and the dove laid eggs at the cave entrance, convincing the pursuers that no one had entered.
*   **The Quote:** Abu Bakr (RA) was afraid, and the Prophet (PBUH) said: *"What do you think of two, the third of whom is Allah?"*

### Hiking Advice
*   **Start Early:** Do not attempt in the day heat.
*   **Pacing:** It is an endurance hike. Take breaks.
*   **The Cave:** Unlike Hira, Thawr is more like a hollow rock formation. You can crawl inside.

    *   **Myth:** You *must* climb it. **False.** Standing anywhere in Arafat is valid. Climbing causes unnecessary overcrowding.

**"New Head, New Blade."**

*   **Watch him:** Ensure he unwraps a fresh blade in front of you. If he tries to reuse one, **STOP HIM**.

### Locations & Price
*   **Marwa Exit:** Many shops, but very expensive (30-50 SAR) and rushed.
*   **Clock Tower (Basement/P3):** Clean, AC, price fixed (approx 30-50 SAR).
*   **Ibrahim Al Khalil Rd:** Cheaper shops (15-20 SAR).
*   **Kakiyah/Aziziyah:** Local price (10-15 SAR).

### DIY Option
Many pilgrims carry their own razor/trimmer and shave each other at the hotel to ensure hygiene and save money.

### 2. Dress Code
*   **Ihram:** Regular modest clothing (Abaya/Hijab). No face covering that touches the skin (Niqab should be lifted or propped, though opinions vary).
*   **Footwear:** Socks/Shoes are allowed (unlike men).

### 3. Menstruation (Hayd)
*   **The Rule:** A woman on her period **cannot pray or perform Tawaf**. She **CAN** perform Sa'i, enter the Haram library/corridors (not the main prayer hall), and do Ziyarat.
*   **Scenario A (Before Ihram):** Bathe, wear pads, make Niyyah. Do everything except Tawaf. Wait until clean, then do Tawaf.
*   **Scenario B (Tablet):** Many women take pills (Norethisterone) to delay their cycle during the trip. Consult a doctor before travel.

*   **pins:** 3 Rectangular pins (same as UK, UAE, Singapore).
*   **Voltage:** 220V / 60Hz.

### Compatibility Check
1.  **US/Canada Travelers:** Your devices (Phone chargers, Laptop bricks) are usually dual voltage (110-240V) so you just need a **Plug Adapter**. However, for hair dryers/shavers, check carefully! If it says 110V only, **DO NOT** plug it in; it will burn.
2.  **Europe/Asia Travelers:** You need a **Plug Adapter** (European 2-pin to British 3-pin).

### Where to Buy?
*   **Hotels:** Many 5-star hotels have "Universal Sockets" that accept any plug.
*   **Bin Dawood:** Sells cheap adapters (5-10 SAR).
*   **Street Stalls:** Sells very cheap adapters (2-5 SAR).

### The Short Answer: No.
While Saudi Arabia produces high-quality desalinated water, the **tank and piping systems** in buildings vary in cleanliness.
*   **Recommendation:** Do **NOT** drink tap water in hotels. Use it for washing/showering only.

### What to Drink?
1.  **Zamzam:** In the Haram, drink unlimited Zamzam. It is physically analyzed daily and is 100% safe.
2.  **Bottled Water:** Extremely cheap (1 SAR for 600ml).
    *   **Brands:** Nova, Berain, Hana, Aquafina.
    *   **Sodium:** Check the label if you are on a low-sodium diet (Nova is usually low sodium).

### Brushing Teeth?
*   It is generally safe to brush teeth with tap water. However, if you have a very sensitive stomach, use bottled water.

Hotel laundry services can bankrupt you (e.g., 20 SAR for a pair of socks). Here is how to save money.

### 1. Local Laundromats ("Maghsala")
Found in backstreets (Ibrahim Al Khalil Rd, Shisha, Aziziyah).
*   **Sign:** Look for "Steam Ironing" or clothes hanging in windows.
*   **Cost:**
    *   Thobe/Jubbah: 3-5 SAR.
    *   Trousers/Shirt: 2-3 SAR.
    *   Wash & Iron Service: Usually ready in 24 hours.
*   **Service:** They wash, dry, and press professionally.

### 2. DIY (Hotel Sink)
*   **Drying:** The air in Makkah/Madinah is very dry.
*   **Tip:** Wash your undergarments/socks in the sink at night. Hang them in the bathroom (hotels usually have a retractable line). They will likely be dry by morning.
*   **Detergent:** Buy a small packet of Tide/Arial from Bin Dawood (2-3 SAR).

You will encounter beggars. It is emotional, but you must be wise.

### Common Scams
1.  **"lost Wallet/Passport":** A well-dressed person approaches you, claims they lost everything, and needs money for a ticket home. **99% Scam.**
2.  **The Medical Paper:** Someone showing a prescription. Often fake.
3.  **Child Exploitation:** Women sitting with sleeping babies (often sedated) in the heat.

### How to Give Sadaqah Safeley?
1.  **Cleaning Staff:** The workers in green/blue overalls in the Haram are often low-paid guest workers. Giving them cash is a direct act of kindness (do it discreetly).
2.  **Official Fridges:** Many shops have "Free Water" fridges. Buying a carton of water/juice to put there is great Sadaqah.
3.  **Ehsan Platform:** The official Saudi app for charity. 100% of money goes to verified cases.

Getting separated in a crowd of 2 million people is terrifying. Mobile signals often fail inside.

### 1. Establish a Meeting Point (BEFORE you enter)
**Bad:** "Meet at the gate" (Which one? Inside or out? It's crowded).
**Good:** "Meet at the specific gold pillar inside the Clock Tower Mall entrance" or "Meet at the Bin Dawood Pharmacy sign."

### 2. The "Clock Tower Compass"
If lost outside, look up. The **Clock Tower** is visible from everywhere. Use it to orient yourself (The Clock Tower is South/East side).

### 3. For Children
*   **Wristband:** Write your hotel name and phone number on a wristband (or pieces of tape on their back).
*   **Photo:** Take a photo of your child/elderly parent *that morning* so you know exactly what they are wearing.
*   **Lost & Found:** There is a center near Al-Marwa. Police are very helpful with lost kids.

2.  **Dates First:** Eat a date first to sweeten your mouth, then sip the coffee.
3.  **The Shake:**
    *   **Want more?** Just hand the cup back to the server. They will keep pouring.
    *   **Finished?** **Shake the cup** gently from side to side before handing it back. This signals "I am done, thank you."

1.  **Yamama Gold Souq:** Outside King Fahd Gate area. The oldest and most concentrated market.
2.  **Clock Tower/Makkah Towers:** High-end shops, high making charges.

### Tips
*   **Price:** Gold rate is fixed globally. You are bargaining on the **"Making Charge"** (labor cost).
*   **Invoice:** Always ask for a computer-generated invoice with weight, karat, and shop details. It is required for customs at the airport.
*   **Customs:** Check your home country's limit on bringing gold back!

*   **Symbolism:** Historians note that the chaos (Fitna) in the Ummah began shortly after the loss of this ring.

### Location

2.  **40 Ounces of Gold.**

### The Miracle
The Prophet (PBUH) told Salman to dig the holes. The Prophet (PBUH) then **planted each shoot with his own blessed hands** (except one, planted by Umar).
*   **Result:** The trees grew miraculously fast and bore fruit within a year (normally takes 5-10 years).
*   **The One Tree:** The only tree that died was the one *not* planted by the Prophet (PBUH). He replanted it, and it thrived.

### Visiting Today
The garden is located near Masjid Quba. It still produces dates (Ajwa and others). Within it is a well associated with the Prophet (PBUH). Visitors can buy dates from this blessed soil.

        content: `
Umrah with kids is rewarding but exhausting.

### The Stroller Rule
*   **Mataf (Kaaba Floor):** Strollers are generally **BANNED** on the ground floor Mataf entirely.
*   **Upper Floors:** Strollers are allowed on the upper floors of Tawaf and Sa'i.
*   **Masjid Nabawi:** Strollers are usually not allowed inside the carpeted prayer halls. You must leave them outside in the courtyard (unsupervised).

### Practical Tips
1.  **Baby Carrier:** Bring a strap-on carrier (Baby Bjorn style). It is a lifesaver for Tawaf on the ground floor.
2.  **Diapers:** Available at Bin Dawood. Brands like Pampers/Huggies are common.
3.  **Milk:** Fresh milk and formula are widely available.
4.  **The Crowd:** Do not take small kids into the crush near the Black Stone. It is dangerous. Stay on the outer perimeter.
5.  **Wristband:** Tag your child!

### Distractions
*   Bring silent toys. Tablets with headphones are okay in corners, but respect the sanctity of the mosque.

You come out of prayer, and your shoes are gone. Either stolen or moved by cleaners.

### Prevention (The Only Cure)
**CARRY YOUR SHOES WITH YOU.**
*   **Shoe Bag:** Buy a string bag. Put your shoes in it. Tie it to your belt or carry it. **Never** leave expensive shoes on the racks outside.

### If They Are Gone...
1.  **Don't Panic.**
2.  **Look Nearby:** Cleaners sometimes sweep piles of "messy" shoes into unmatched heaps nearby. Check the piles.
3.  **Heat Danger:** The marble outside the Haram (sunny areas) gets **boiling hot**. You cannot walk barefoot on it at 2 PM. You will burn your feet.
4.  **The Fix:**
    *   Walk in the shade/white marble (cool tiles).
    *   Find the nearest stall (usually many on the perimeter). Buy cheap plastic slides (10-15 SAR).
    *   Or ask a cleaner/guard for advice; sometimes they have a "Lost & Found" pile.

        content: `
Finding a quiet time allows for a spiritual connection with the Kaaba.

### The "Golden Times"
1.  **Late Morning (9 AM - 11 AM):**
    *   Most pilgrims are sleeping after Fajr or eating breakfast.
    *   The sun is up, so the open Mataf is hotter, but the crowd is thin.
2.  **Post-Isha (11 PM - 1 AM):**
    *   Dinner rush is over. Some have gone to sleep.

### The "Nightmare Times"
1.  **Immediately after Prayer:**
    *   Example: Right after Maghrib/Isha. Everyone rushes to do Tawaf. Wait 30 mins.
2.  **Pre-Jummah:** Friday morning is packed.
3.  **Ramadan Nights:** The peaks shift (everything is busy at night).

### Heat vs. Crowd
*   If you can handle the **sun** (or use an umbrella), the **Dhuhr-Asr** window is often the emptiest on the ground floor. The heat scares people away.

Transport is the #1 place pilgrims lose money.

### 1. The "Meter is Broken" Scam
*   **The Scenario:** You get in. The driver says "Meter broken, fixed price 100 Riyals."
*   **The Reality:** The ride should cost 20-30 Riyals.
*   **The Fix:** **ALWAYS** demand the meter ("Shaghghal Adad"). If he refuses, get out.

### 2. The Airport Shark (Jeddah)
*   **The Scenario:** Guys inside the arrivals hall whisper "Taxi? Makkah? Cheap?". They are **illegal touts**.
*   **The Risk:** They lure you to a private car far away, then charge triple or demand extra for luggage halfway.
*   **The Fix:** Ignore them. Go to the **Official Taxi Queue** outside or the **Uber/Careem pickup zone**.

### 3. The "Per Person" Trick
*   **The Scenario:** You agree on "50 Riyals". Upon arrival, he says "50 *per person*!" (Total 200).
*   **The Fix:** Clarify loudly before getting in: "50 Riyals **TOTAL** (Kulluh)?". Shake hands on it.

KSA has strict anti-fraud laws. Every SIM is linked to a fingerprint.

### The Process
1.  **Buy:** You present passport/visa.
2.  **Scan:** You place fingers on the scanner.
3.  **Active:** It activates instantly.

### Common Problems
*   **"System Down" at Airport:** Often happens.
    *   **Solution:** Don't panic. Go to the city (Makkah/Madinah). Visit a main branch of STC/Mobily. They can register you there.
*   **Faded Fingerprints:** Elderly pilgrims (manual workers) often have worn fingerprints.
    *   **Solution:** The staff can try multiple fingers. If all fail, the supervisor can sometimes override with a photo/passport verification (depends on provider).
*   **Data Only:** Sometimes "Data Only" SIMs have easier registration than "Voice + Data".

The **Nusuk** app is great, but buggy.

### "User Suspended"
This terrifying message usually appears if:
1.  You booked a permit and **didn't show up** (No-Show).
2.  You tried to hack/bot the system.
*   **The Fix:** You are usually banned for a specific period (e.g., 2 weeks). You cannot fix it immediately. Try creating a **new account** with a different email/passport (if you have dual nationality) or wait.

### "App Crashing"
*   **Fix:**
    1.  Update the App.
    2.  Clear Cache.
    3.  **Use a VPN:** Sometimes Nusuk servers block IPs from certain countries. Once you are in Saudi (on Saudi WiFi), it works better.

### Login Issues
*   Ensure your visa number is entered correctly. Do not copy-paste (sometimes adds invisible spaces). Type it manually.

### Official Cargo
*   **Saudi Post (SPL):** Reliable but expensive. They have specific rules on liquids.
*   **DHL / Aramex:** Very expensive. Often reject liquids (Zamzam) due to safety/leakage risks.

### The "Local Cargo" ( The Real Solution)
In areas like **Misfalah** (Makkah) or near **Bangali Market** (Madinah), dozens of Cargo Shops exist.
*   **How it works:** They pack your Dates/Prayer Mats/Zamzam in huge boxes.
*   **Rate:** Charged per KG (e.g., 10-15 SAR per kg to UK/USA/India).
*   **Delivery:** By Sea (slow - 1 month) or Air (fast - 1 week).
*   **Warning:** **Zamzam is risky.** Official customs in your home country might seize it. Dates/Clothes are safe. Most cargo guys will tell you "We will try sending Zamzam, but no guarantee."

*   **The Map:** If it shows "Stationary" in a building (likely a hotel or police station), go there. If it is "Moving" fast, it's in a taxi/thief's hand.

### 2. The Police Station (Lost & Found)
*   **Location:** Access via the tunnel near **Al-Marwa** or ask a guard for "Mabaahith" or "Amn".
*   **The pile of phones:** They often have drawers full of recovered phones. You need to describe yours (Lock screen photo, case color).
*   **Report:** You need a police report for your travel insurance claim. It takes time and Arabic translation.

### 3. Replacement
*   **Used Phones:** Go to mobile shops in **Aziziyah** or **Ibrahim Khalil Road**. You can buy a cheap Android for 200 SAR to finish your trip.

In Makkah, **Location is King**. A 3-star hotel at the gate is often more valuable than a 5-star hotel 5km away.

### The "Distance Trap"
Hotels often list "5 minutes from Haram".
*   **The Catch:** That's 5 minutes *by car* (at 3 AM with no traffic). At prayer time, it's 45 minutes.
*   **Verify:** Check Google Maps walking distance. If it's >1.5km, you need a shuttle bus.

### The "Shuttle Bus" Reality
Hotels in **Aziziyah** or **Kudai** offer 24/7 shuttles.
*   **Pros:** Cheap luxury.
*   **Cons:** Post-prayer traffic jams. The bus drops you at bus stations (e.g., Kudai), which is still a 10 min walk to the actual Haram gate.

### Star Standards
*   **Clock Tower 5-Star:** World-class (Fairmont, Raffles).
*   **Older 5-Star (Ajyad):** Might have worn carpets and older furniture. Read recent reviews!

*   **Trade-off:** You must take a bus/taxi to Haram. Ideally, stay near a **Makkah Bus** stop (Free/Cheap bus).

### 2. Food
*   **Avoid:** Hotel buffets (150+ SAR) and Clock Tower Food Court (30-50 SAR/meal).
*   **Eat:**
    *   **Foul & Tamees:** (Bean stew & huge bread). Breakfast for 3 people = 5 SAR.
    *   **Broasted Chicken:** 15-18 SAR (Lunch).
    *   **Shawarma:** 5-8 SAR.
    *   **Pakistani/Bengali Restaurants:** You can get Biryani for 10-15 SAR.

### 3. Water
*   **Bring a Bottle:** Fill it with **Zamzam** inside the Haram. It's free. Don't buy water bottles.

### 4. Transport
*   **Makkah Bus:** The new public bus system is excellent and very cheap (often free during trials, or 4 SAR). Use it instead of taxis.

### Requirements
*   **License:**

Away from city lights, **Gharameel** offers a landscape that looks like another planet.

### The Experience
*   **The Rocks:** Thin, vertical rock pillars shooting up from the sand.
*   **The Sky:** Zero light pollution. You can see the Milky Way with the naked eye.
*   **The Tour:** Includes a BBQ dinner on mats in the middle of nowhere. A guide uses a laser pointer to explain constellations.

### Tips
*   **Clothing:** It gets **freezing** at night in the desert (even in spring). Wear heavy layers.
*   **Moon:** Check the moon phase. Go during a New Moon for the best stars.

Before you enter Ihram, you MUST know which **Type of Hajj** you are doing.

### 1. Hajj al-Tamattu (The Most Common)
*   **For:** Pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Enter Ihram for **Umrah** first (during Hajj months).
    2.  Complete Umrah and **Exit Ihram** (cut hair). Relax in Makkah.
    3.  Enter Ihram *again* for **Hajj** on 8th Dhul Hijjah.
*   **Sacrifice:** Required (Hady).

### 2. Hajj al-Qiran (The Prophet's Way)
*   **For:** Those bringing their sacrifice animal with them (rare now).
*   **Process:** Enter Ihram for **Umrah AND Hajj** together. You DO NOT exit Ihram after Umrah. You stay in Ihram until Hajj ends.
*   **Sacrifice:** Required.

### 3. Hajj al-Ifrad (Hajj Only)
*   **For:** Residents of Makkah or those arriving very late.
*   **Process:** Ihram for **Hajj Only**. No Umrah.
*   **Sacrifice:** NOT required.

        content: `
Entering Ihram is easy; staying in it is hard.

### Common Mistakes
1.  **Scented Soap/Wipes:** Using "Dove" or "Lux" before Jumuah/Ihram is fine, but **AFTER** Niyyah, you must use **Unscented Soap**. No wet wipes with perfume!
2.  **Covering the Head (Men):** Putting a blanket over your face/head while sleeping in Mina.
    *   **Rule:** Face and Head must remain uncovered for men.
3.  **Wearing Underwear (Men):** It happens. You forget.
4.  **Knotting the Towel:** You should use a belt. Do not tie knots in the Ihram cloth itself (though scholars differ, it is safer to avoid).
5.  **Thinking "Stitched" means "Sewn":**
    *   **Rule:** "Stitched" means "Form Fitted" (like a shirt/pants). A patch sewn onto your Ihram or sandals/belt with stitching is **Allowed**.

### The Fix (Fidiya)
If you do these by accident: Istighfar (Repent).
If you do them on purpose or due to necessity: You may need to feed 6 poor people (Fidiya).

This is the #1 worry for sisters. Here is the simplified Fiqh.

### The Golden Rule
**A woman on her period can do EVERYTHING in Hajj/Umrah EXCEPT: Tawaf and Prayer (Salah).**

### Scenarios
1.  **Period starts BEFORE Ihram (at Meeqat):**
    *   **Action:** Shower, Enter Ihram, Make Niyyah. Go to Makkah.
    *   **Wait:** Stay in your hotel. Do **NOT** go to the Masjid (Haram).
    *   **Clean:** When period ends, Ghusl -> Go do Tawaf & Sa'i -> Cut hair.

2.  **Period starts AFTER Tawaf but BEFORE Sa'i:**
    *   **Action:** You CAN do Sa'i! (Tahara is not a requirement for Sa'i, only for Tawaf). Complete Sa'i, cut hair, finish.

3.  **Delay Pills (Primolut N):**
    *   Most scholars allow taking pills to delay the cycle for Umrah. Start taking them 3-5 days before travel. Consult a doctor.

3.  **Between Yemeni Corner & Black Stone (Last stretch):**
    *   *"Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil 'akhirati hasanatan waqina 'adhaban-nar"* (Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire).

### Sa'i
1.  **On Safa/Marwa Hill:** Face Qibla. Raise hands.
    *   *"Innas-safa wal-marwata min sha'a'irillah..."* (Only first time).
    *   Recite the Dua of Tawheed (La ilaha illAllah...).
    *   Make long personal Dua.
2.  **Green Lights (Men run):** *"Rabbighfir warham..."* (Lord forgive and have mercy).

*   **New Account:** Some claim deleting the account and re-registering works, but it is risky and not recommended.

### For Umrah
*   **Ruling:** Scholars differ.
    *   **Majority:** It is Mustahabb (Recommended) but NOT Wajib. You can skip it.
    *   **Best Practice:** If you have time, do it. It is respectful.

### Women on Period
*   **Ruling:** They are **EXEMPT** from Farewell Tawaf. They do not need to do it and do not owe any penalty. They can just stand at the gate and make Dua before leaving.

### Al Tazaj (The King of Grilled)

*   **Best Item:** Whole Grilled Chicken with Buhari Rice.
*   **Price:** Slightly higher (~25-30 SAR).
*   **Healthier:** Yes, because it's grilled, not fried.
*   **Vibe:** Sit-down family dining.

*   **Taxis/Uber:** Rounding up (e.g., let them keep the change from 20 for an 18 SAR ride) is common.
*   **Bellboys/Cleaners:** It is Sunnah (Charity) to help low-income workers. Giving 5-10 SAR to a cleaner or porter is seen as a kind act of Sadaqah/gift rather than a "tip".

### For Men

    *   **Mosques:** Knees MUST be covered.
    *   **Govt Buildings:** Long pants required.

### 1. The Right Hand Rule
*   **Eat, Drink, Give, Take:** ALWAYS with the **Right Hand**. The left hand is considered unclean (historically used for hygiene).

### 2. Greetings
*   **Men:** Handshakes are common. Cheek kissing (one, two, three) is for friends.
*   **Women:** Do not offer to shake a hand with the opposite gender unless they offer first. A hand on the chest with a nod is a respectful alternative.

### 3. Shoes
*   **Homes/Mosques:** 100% Shoes OFF. Look at the door; if there is a pile of shoes, take yours off.

### 4. Coffee (Qahwa)
*   If offered, accept it. It is rude to refuse hospitality. (Drink at least one tiny cup).

### 5. Photos
*   Do not take photos of random women or government buildings. It is illegal and offensive.

Honey in Saudi Arabia is serious business.

### Types
1.  **Sidr (Royal):** Monofloral honey from the Lote tree. Thick, caramel taste. Immune booster.
    *   **Price:** Expensive (300 - 800 SAR/kg).
2.  **Talh (Acacia):** Darker, reddish. Good for digestion and diabetics (lower sucrose).
3.  **Samra:** Dark, strong taste. Good for coughs.

### The "Match Test"
*   (Myth): Lighting a match dipped in honey proves it's pure.
*   **Reality:** Just taste it. Pure Sidr burns the throat slightly (aftertaste). Buy from reputable shops like **Asal Al-Barri** or **Al-Nahl Al-Jawal**.

### Can you see it?

### Science
*   The water level is only about 10 feet deep, yet it supplies millions of liters daily. It replenishes itself in 11 minutes.
