**The Meeqat (Site of Intention)** is the geographic boundary that a pilgrim intending to perform Hajj or Umrah **must not cross** without assuming **Ihram** (state of ritual purity).

There are **5 specific Meeqat locations** established by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Bypassing these boundaries without Ihram requires a **Damm (sacrifice of a sheep)** as expiation.

### Table: The 5 Meeqat Locations

| Meeqat Name | Distance from Makkah | For Pilgrims Coming From |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dhul Hulaifah (Abyar Ali)** | 450 km (North) | Madinah |
| **Al-Juhfah (Rabigh)** | 183 km (North-West) | Egypt, Syria, North Africa, Europe |
| **Qarn al-Manazil (As-Sayl Al-Kabir)** | 75 km (East) | Riyadh, Taif, UAE, Pakistan, India |
| **Yalamlam (Sa'adiyah)** | 92 km (South) | Yemen, South Africa, Nigeria |
| **Dhat Irq** | 94 km (North-East) | Iraq, Iran, Eastern Saudi Arabia |

## 1. Dhul Hulaifah (Abyar Ali) – The Furthest Meeqat
Located **450 kilometers north of Makkah**, this is the Meeqat for pilgrims traveling from **Madinah**. It is often called **Abyar Ali** today.
*   **Significance:** It is where the Prophet (PBUH) entered Ihram for his pilgrimage.
*   **Facilities:** Includes a large mosque (Masjid Al-Shajarah) with extensive bathing and changing facilities.

## 2. Al-Juhfah (Rabigh)
Historically a village, now located near **Rabigh** (approx. 183km from Makkah).
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Egypt, Levant, and North America/Europe traveling via the coastal route.

## 3. Qarn al-Manazil (As-Sayl Al-Kabir)
Located **75km east of Makkah**, near Taif.
*   **For:** Visitors from Riyadh, Dammam, Dubai, Pakistan, and India.
*   **Note:** There is a second location called *Wadi Mahram* for those descending from Taif via the mountain road.

## 4. Yalamlam (Sa'adiyah)
Located **92km south of Makkah**.
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Yemen and those crossing the Red Sea by ship from the south.

## 5. Dhat Irq
Located **94km north-east**.
*   **For:** Pilgrims from Iraq and Iran.
*   **Status:** It is less accessible by modern highways compared to others.

### Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I am flying to Jeddah?
**Jeddah is NOT a Meeqat.** It is inside the boundary. If you fly to Jeddah for Umrah:
1.  **Wear Ihram on the plane** before crossing the Meeqat zone (usually 20-30 mins before landing).
2.  Or, travel to a Meeqat (like Dhul Hulaifah if going to Madinah first) by taxi.

### Can I wear Ihram at my hotel in Makkah?
**No**, unless you are already a resident of Makkah (Hil). For Umrah, you must go out to the nearest boundary (like Masjid Aisha/Taneem) if you are already in the city.

### Pros and Cons of Taxi to Meeqat
**Pros:**
*   Comfortable changing stops.
*   Direct travel to Makkah Haram.
*   No luggage hassle.

**Cons:**
*   More expensive than bus.
