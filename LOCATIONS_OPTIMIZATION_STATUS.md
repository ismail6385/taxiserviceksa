# Location Pages Optimization Status

## Overview
Status of the "Blue Hat" SEO optimization for location pages, following Koray Tuğberk's holistic SEO principles.

## Strict Rules Applied
- **Contact**: No phone numbers (`tel:`), No WhatsApp links. Email (`mailto:taxiserviceksa9988@gmail.com`) and Booking Form (`/booking`) ONLY.
- **Content**: Entity-first language. No marketing hype ("Best", "Reliable" removed). Micro-semantic structure.
- **H1**: Service-First format (e.g., "Taxi Service in X: Service A & Service B").
- **Meta**: Factual descriptions with entities.

## Progress

| Location | Status | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Makkah** | ✅ Completed | Optimized H1, Meta, FAQs (Micro-Semantic), Removed `tel:` links. |
| **Madinah** | ✅ Completed | Optimized H1, Meta, FAQs, Content. Fixed H2 nesting bug. |
| **Jeddah** | ✅ Completed | Optimized H1, Meta, FAQs, Content. |
| **Taif** | ✅ Completed | Optimized H1, Meta, FAQs, Content. |
| **Khaybar Fort** | ✅ Completed | Optimized H1, Meta, FAQs, Content. |
| **AlUla** | ❌ Skipped | Directory exists but is empty. |
| **Riyadh** | ❌ Pending | Page does not exist. |
| **Yanbu** | ❌ Pending | Page does not exist. |

## Next Steps
1.  **Create/Fill AlUla Page**: The directory `app/locations/alula` is empty. Needs content.
2.  **Create Riyadh & Yanbu Pages**: These are missing entirely.
3.  **Monitor**: specific ranking signals for these new "fact-heavy" pages.
